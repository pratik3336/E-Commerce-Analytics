This project focuses on unlocking valuable insights from e-commerce sales data using **Python** and **scikit-learn**. The primary goal is to better understand customer behavior and transform raw transactional data into actionable business intelligence.

The workflow begins with **data preparation**, where raw datasets are cleaned, formatted, and structured to ensure reliable analysis. This step includes handling missing values, data transformation, and feature engineering to create a strong analytical foundation.

The core of the project lies in **customer segmentation using K-Means clustering**. By applying machine learning techniques, customers are grouped into meaningful segments based on purchasing patterns and behavioral characteristics. These segments help reveal preferences, spending habits, and engagement trends.

To improve model accuracy, **hyperparameter tuning and evaluation techniques** are applied to refine the clustering performance. This ensures that the resulting segments closely reflect real customer behavior rather than arbitrary groupings.

### 🚀 Outcomes & Business Impact

* Better understanding of customer segments and buying behavior
* Data-driven marketing and personalization strategies
* Improved customer engagement and retention
* Enhanced decision-making for product and sales optimization

This project demonstrates how machine learning can transform raw e-commerce data into strategic insights that drive business growth.
